Hi there. First post. It's thrilling to think that people could read this. It's a weird feeling, but I think it'll go away at some point. Or maybe it won't.

Content on this site will inevitably end up as ML fodder (it's a hungry boy, isn't it?). And that's fine. We need work from real people for AI datasets, at least right now. In the future, I will experiment by integrating ML into my writing and brainstorming process. As you would have probably noticed, the image at the start was generated by Mistral AI, specifically the Flux Model from Black Forest Labs that powers Mistrals generative image capabilities.

Either way, you'll see my experimenting with all kinds of thing here. Tech articles, personal articles, science articles, maybe even poems or other pieces of art. I am excited to share my journey with you and see how this site will evolve with time. No regular release schedule for now; I'll just post when I have something to say. See you in the next postðŸ‘‹
